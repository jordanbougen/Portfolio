      <div class="about_me">
        <p> Hi. My name is Jordan. I am 18 years old and I am a first year student at the Massey University Wellington
            campus, studying a Bachelor of Design (with Hons.) majoring in Visual Communication Design.
            My hobbies include eating, exercising, reading and anything related to art.</p>
        <p> I have had a very creative childhood, immersing myself in the arts whenever I could. I was very passionate
            about drawing and other art forms from a young age, taking interest in the art activities in primary school,
            take extra-curricular art classes and then continuing on through high school taking Art Painting,
            Art Design and Art History.</p>

        <h2>fun facts</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>My favourite food is anything pasta or pizza related. (Although chocolate is also a fierce competitor).</li>
          <li>My dream job is to work at Google or a fancy design establishment.</li>
          <li>I was a top Artistic Figure Skater in New Zealand and Australia before I quit 2 years ago
              to focus on my future.</li>
          <li>My favourite books from childhood and now are The Faraway Tree stories by Enid Blyton
              and the Throne of Glass series by Sarah J. Maas.</li>
          <li>I am part Maori, English, Scottish, French and Croatian.</li>
          <li>My favourite movie of all time is Tangled.</li>
          <li>I identify the mighty sloth as my spirit animal.</li>
